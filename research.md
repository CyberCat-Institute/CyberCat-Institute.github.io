## Machine learning

### A unified view of machine learning

Machine learning is currently developing at a pace that even full-time researchers find unmanageable, with literally hundreds of new papers every day on arXiv. This seems an insurmountable problem to those whose goal is to understand these systems deeply enough to control them, a much task much harder than creating new systems.

However, our research has revealed a hidden unity between seemingly very different areas of ML, including deep learning, reinforcement learning and variational inference. Also included are some models of human learning, including models from economics and neuroscience. This provides an "atlas" to navigate the endless variations of ML, and a useful level of abstraction for studying them.

## Economics

### The Open Game Engine

The Open Game Engine is our flagship open source software for computational game theory. It is an embedded domain specific language that extends the functional programming language Haskell with a powerful syntax for defining games in a compositional way, and then running computational analyses on them.

### Algorithmic pricing and collusion

We are investigating the possible collusive behaviour of pricing algorithms in realistic training environments, using a reinforcement learning framework built on top of the Open Game Engine. You can read more about this project in this paper.

### Incentives analysis of smart contracts

Supported by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation, we are developing applications of the Open Game Engine to game-theoretic analysis of smart contracts, for example for token auctions and DeFi contracts. You can read about this project here. We are also working on integration with the dapptools project to partially automate this process.
