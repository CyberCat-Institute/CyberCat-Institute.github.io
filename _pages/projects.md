    name: "Open Games Engine"
    description: "The [Open Game Engine](https://github.com/CyberCat-Institute/open-game-engine) is our flagship open source software for computational game theory. It is an embedded domain specific language that extends the functional programming language Haskell with a powerful syntax for defining games in a compositional way, and then running computational analyses on them."

    name: "Smart contract incentives analysis"
    description: "Supported by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation, we are developing applications of the Open Game Engine to game-theoretic analysis of smart contracts, for example for token auctions and DeFi contracts. [You can read about this project here.](https://statebox.org/blog/compositional-game-engine/) We are also working on integration with the [dapptools](https://dapp.org.uk/) project to partially automate this process."

    name: "Algorithmic pricing and collusion"
    description: "We are investigating the possible collusive behaviour of pricing algorithms in realistic training environments, using a reinforcement learning framework built on top of the Open Game Engine. You can read more about this project in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00345)."

    name: "Foundations of categorical cybernetics"
    description: "A team of academic collaborators based mainly at the [MSP Group](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/index.html) in Glasgow are studying the category-theoretic structure of general cybernetic systems, and the ways in which different real-world methods and problems map onto these structures. This includes deep learning, dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, Bayesian and variational learning, and economic game theory. You can read more in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06332)."
